# Brain-Music-Dynamic-Modeling-DCM-VAR-Analysis
Advanced neurodynamic modeling of music processing using Dynamic Causal Modeling and Vector Autoregression

# Overview
This repository implements cutting-edge computational methods for modeling dynamic brain-music interactions using:

Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for causal inference in neural networks
Vector Autoregression (VAR) for time series analysis of brain dynamics
Gradient-based phase space analysis for brain state modeling
Bayesian model selection for optimal model identification

# Key Innovation
We demonstrate how endogenous neural dynamics dominate music processing rather than direct acoustic driving, revealing the brain's sophisticated predictive machinery underlying musical experience.
